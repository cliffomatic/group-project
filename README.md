=============

Josh, Michael and I got started on integrating our pieces.  I am still having trouble reading the search page from the array.  When I comment out the code for search, profile works.  But when I un comment the search btn code then profile doesn't work.

Integrating our pieces has been very hard.  I want to learn how to control layers outside the given class if possible.  For instance a modal being presented should be on top of everything - even the navigation but that doesn't seem possible.
